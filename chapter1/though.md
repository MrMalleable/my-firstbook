词语辨析

[although](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/although)

[even though](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/even%20though)

[though](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/though)

You can use these words to show contrast between two clauses or two sentences. Though is used more in spoken than in written English. You can use although , even though and though at the beginning of a sentence or clause that has a verb. Notice where the commas go. 在两个从句或句子之间可用上述的词表示对比。though多用于口语。although、even though和though可用于句首或带有动词的从句开头。注意逗号的位置：

Although/Even though/Though everyone played well, we lost the game.



We lost the game, although/even though/though everyone played well.

尽管每个人都打得不错，我们还是输了。

You cannot use even on its own at the beginning of a sentence or clause instead of although , even though or though . even不能单独置于句首或从句开头以代替although、even though或though：

~~Even everyone played well, we lost the game.~~

though和athough的区别：

though和although在意义上几乎毫无区别，但文体上后者是较正式用词，语气比though强。此外，在习惯用法上这两个词仍有以下一些差异：

1. though可引出倒装语序的让步状语从句，although 则不能。

2. though可与even连用，although则不能；在as though结构中，只用though，不能用although。

3. though可以置于从句末，而although则不能。

4. 引出省略句时，通常用though。
